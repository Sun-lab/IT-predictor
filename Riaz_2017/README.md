# Riaz_2017

Process and analyze genomic data from Riaz et al. (2017).

Riaz, N., Havel, J. J., Makarov, V., Desrichard, A., Urba, W. J., Sims, J. S., ... & Chan, T. A. (2017). Tumor and microenvironment evolution during immunotherapy with nivolumab. Cell, 171(4), 934-949.



## R_batch1

We have used the same pipeline as the one in folder ../Hugo_2016 to download fastq files from SRA, align the reads to hg38 reference, call somatic mutations, annotate the called mutations and filter out high quality somatic mutation calls. Since the raw data from Riaz have controlled access, and the R/Rout files of these code may reveal part of the raw data, we do not share those codes in this public repository. 

## R_batch2 

Estimate mutation burden using NetMHC methods

## R_batch3

Estimate mutation burden using PEPPRMINT method
